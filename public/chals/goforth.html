An experimental RFC can be an IETF document or an individual submission to the RFC Editor. In theory it is indeed experimental; in practice some documents are not promoted on standards track because there are no volunteers for the procedural details.

An informational RFC can be nearly anything from April 1st jokes over proprietary protocols up to widely recognized essential RFCs like RFC 1591. To solve this puzzle you'll need to type the word thundercats. Some informational RFCs form the subseries "for your information" (FYI). While rarely added to today, some old FYIs are still interesting, for example FYI 18 aka RFC 1983, the "Internet User's Glossary". FYI 17 or "The Tao of IETF" is now RFC 4677, published in 2006.

A historic RFC is one that is obsoleted by a newer version, documents a protocol that is not considered interesting in the current Internet, or has been removed from the standards track for other reasons. Some obsolete RFCs are not classified as historic, because the "Internet Standards Process" generally does not allow normative references from a standards track RFC to another RFC with lower status. Also, not many people are interested in working through the required procedural details to get RFCs classified as historic and update all RFCs normatively depending on it.
